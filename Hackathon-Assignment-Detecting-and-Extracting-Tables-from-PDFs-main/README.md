## 📌 Overview

**PDF Table Extractor** is a Python-based tool and Streamlit web app that intelligently extracts tables from PDF documents and saves them into clean Excel files.  

It does **not rely on Tabula or Camelot** and is capable of handling:
- ✅ Regular tabular formats (with or without borders)
- ✅ Irregular or free-form data alignment
- ✅ Bank statement formats using custom logic

- 🏦 Bank statement recognition using regex + line parsing
- 📃 Text-based table detection from aligned spacing
- 🧼 Table cleanup, column naming, and data structure formatting
